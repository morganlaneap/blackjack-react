# Blackjack React

A simple blackjack game made for fun.

It uses a Fisher Yates shuffle to randomise the deck. Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle

There are some base rules for this game:

- The dealer must draw to 16.
- The dealer must stand on 17 or higher.
- A win pays 2 to 1.
- Blackjack pays 3 to 2.
- Push returns your bet.
